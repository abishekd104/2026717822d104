# Hospital Management System

## Description
This Java program is a Hospital Management System that connects to a MySQL database to manage patient records and provide disease-specific guidance. It creates a "Patients" table if it doesn't exist, storing details such as ID, name, and disease. Users input patient data, including ID, name, date of birth, and disease, securely inserted using prepared statements. Based on the disease entered, the program offers tailored advice, such as quarantine protocols for COVID-19 or dietary recommendations for diabetes. It includes a loop allowing continuous data input and exits upon user preference. Overall, it efficiently organizes patient information and offers medical guidance within a compact and user-friendly interface.
